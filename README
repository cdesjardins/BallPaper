An Android app that will read data from the magnetometer and accelerometer, and use
the data to cause a 3D sphere to bounce around in the background of your device.

- The magnetometer is used to get an UP vector to cancel out acceleration due 
   to gravity. 
- The accelerometer is used to detect movement of the Android device.
